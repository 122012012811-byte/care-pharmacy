## 🧪 Testing

### Step 1: Place an Order
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Add medicines to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Fill in customer details:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: 9876543210
   - Address: 123 Test Street
   - City: Mumbai
   - Pincode: 400001
5. Choose payment method (COD/UPI/Card)
6. Place order

### Step 2: Check Database

**In MySQL Workbench:**
```sql
-- See the new customer
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- See the order
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@example.com');

-- See order items
SELECT oi.*, m.name 
FROM order_items oi
JOIN medicines m ON oi.medicine_id = m.id
WHERE oi.order_id = (
  SELECT o.id FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
  WHERE c.email = 'test@example.com'
  LIMIT 1
);

-- See the transaction
SELECT * FROM transactions 
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@example.com');
```

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Get customer history
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5001/api/customers/test@example.com/history | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

# Get all transactions
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5001/api/transactions | ConvertTo-Json
```

### Step 3: Verify Stock Updates
```sql
-- Check stock before and after orders
SELECT name, stock FROM medicines WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```
